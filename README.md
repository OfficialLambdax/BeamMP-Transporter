# BeamMP-Transporter

This is a recreation of the Transporter/Capture the flag gamemode from Dirt 3 for BeamMP

Installation:
  Download the latest release and copy the server and client folders into your server's Resources/ folder

Usage:
  Type `/transporter help` or `/ctf help` in chat to get a list of all the commands. To start a game you can type `/ctf start`.
  Available levels are shown with `/ctf list levels` and available areas with `/ctf list areas`. To change arena type `/ctf area areaName`, where areaName is the name of any area shown with the list command.

Thanks to Olrosse for laying most of the foundation in this project with his Infection gamemode.

Some notes:
 You can create your own areas on any map, in time I will create a tutorial on how to do this. If you find any issues, let me know either through github or the BeamMP forum.
