# BeamMP-Transporter

This is a recreation of the Transporter/Capture the flag gamemode from Dirt 3 for BeamMP

Prerequisites:
  - Cobalt Essentials (https://forum.beammp.com/t/cobalt-essentials-v1-7-6-release/61)

Installation:
  Download the latest release and copy the server and client folders into your server's Resources/ folder

Usage:
  go to the release page and download the latest version, then unpack the zip into the server recourses and it should be good to go,
  then type "/transporter help" or "/ctf help" in chat to get a list of all the commands, then finally to start a game you type /outbreak start.

Thanks to Olrosse for laying most of the foundation in this project with his Infection gamemode.

Some notes:
 There is a lag spike everytime a luatrigger is triggered, I'm still trying to fix that. You can create your own areas on any map, in time I will create a tutorial on how to do this. If you find any issues, let me know either through github or the BeamMP forum.
