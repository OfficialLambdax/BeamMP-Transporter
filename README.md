# BeamMP-Outbreak
Dirt 3 infection/outbreak for beammp

This is a recreation of the Outbreak/Infection mode from Dirt 3 for BeamMP

How to use, in the release build just unpack the zip into the server recourses and it should be good to go, then type /outbreak help in chat to get a list of all the commands, then finally to start a game you type /outbreak start. 

Thanks to Stefan750 for some help with colors and screen tint and Saile for help with the weighted randomizer

Also the Neilogical/Camodo aswell as the Failrace crew for feedback and testing.


Some notes

this build may not be very suitable for public servers yet as it is very easy to cheat, but it's good for private servers where you might have some personalised rules haha

Also feel free to use this mod as reference if you want to make your own game modes, it's not the best documented and there's probably some wacky code haha, but maybe it's helpful to get started
