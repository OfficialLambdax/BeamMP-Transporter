# BeamMP-Transporter

This is a recreation of the Transporter/Capture the flag gamemode from Dirt 3 for BeamMP

Prerequisites:
  - Cobalt Essentials (https://forum.beammp.com/t/cobalt-essentials-v1-7-6-release/61)

Installation:
  Download the latest release and copy the server and client folders into your server's Resources/ folder

Usage:
  Type "/transporter help" or "/ctf help" in chat to get a list of all the commands. To start a game you can type /ctf start.
  This adds flag & goal markers and message boxes for when you get the flag. 

Thanks to Olrosse for laying most of the foundation in this project with his Infection gamemode.

Some notes:
 You can create your own areas on any map, in time I will create a tutorial on how to do this. If you find any issues, let me know either through github or the BeamMP forum.
