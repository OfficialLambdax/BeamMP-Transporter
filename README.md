# BeamMP-Outbreak
Dirt 3 infection/outbreak for beammp

This is a recreation of the Outbreak/Infection mode from Dirt 3 for BeamMP

How to use, in the release build just unpack the zip into the server recourses and it should be good to go, then type /outbreak help in chat to get a list of all the commands, then finally to start a game you type /outbreak start. 

Thanks to Stefan750 for some help with colors and screen tint and Saile for help with the weighted randomizer

Also the Neilogical/Camodo aswell as the Failrace crew for feedback and testing
